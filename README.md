Pictures are randomly fetched from https://picsum.photos/ and broken into 4x4 pieces. Player then need to reconstruct back the picture as in the traditional jigsaw puzzle.
This project is still experimental as the drag-and-drop still feels laggy using Flutter's Draggable class. Might need to resort to different ways later.

More to be added later.
